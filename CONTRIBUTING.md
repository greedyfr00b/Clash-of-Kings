Thanks for your interest in improving **Clash of Kings**!

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make changes and open a PR to `main` with a clear description and screenshots if UI changes.
3. Ensure `index.html` still runs locally without errors.

## Coding Guidelines
- Keep the game self-contained and framework-free.
- Favor clarity over cleverness in the AI â€” readable logic wins.
- Test on mobile: ensure buttons are reachable and text is legible.
